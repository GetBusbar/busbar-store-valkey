//! The [`busbar_contract::records::RecordStore`] contract conformance suite, OWNED by this backend.
//!
//! PROVENANCE: the `conf` module's body below is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the one in busbar's
//! `crates/store-memory/tests/store_conformance.rs` at the busbar rev this repo pins (`.busbar-ref`,
//! 8b7b6473f47f8d37ae60839c74cfe6a9b64a1dc9) — core's reference backend runs the same checks. It was
//! `busbar-plugin-testkit` until the owner ruled that crate deleted (2026-09-22); #2/#31 forbid a
//! shared test util between plugins, so each backend owns its copy. Only this header and the module's
//! `pub(super)` (so `src/tests.rs` can call it) are new. The
//! backend's wiring (namespacing and cleanup against the shared live Valkey) is in `src/tests.rs`.

// The `Store` contract conformance suite. It WAS `busbar-plugin-testkit`; the owner ruled that
// crate deleted on 2026-09-22 and #2 forbids a shared test util between plugins, so this backend
// owns its copy. See the module doc inside for the full provenance.
#[allow(dead_code)]
pub(super) mod conf {
    //! # PROVENANCE, 2026-09-22 — this file was `busbar-plugin-testkit`
    //!
    //! The owner ruled the shared testkit crate DELETED (*"delete it. wtf is a testkit."*), which
    //! DECISIONS #33 already asserted (*"There is NO `testkit` — dead, not a crate and not a feature:
    //! each plugin self-tests (#2); the kernel tests no plugin"*). #2/#31 are the reason the suite could
    //! not simply move to one crate and be shared from there: a plugin is a 3rd party living in its own
    //! repo, and cross-plugin shared test utils are exactly what that topology forbids.
    //!
    //! So the suite is COPIED, not relocated, and each backend owns its copy outright. The duplication
    //! is the ruled design, not an accident of the move — the cost #2 accepts in exchange for a plugin
    //! that can be built and tested with no sibling in the tree. Every assertion below is BYTE-IDENTICAL
    //! to the testkit's last version; only this header is new.
    //!
    //! The "reaches every backend on its next dependency bump" promise in the doc above is therefore
    //! NO LONGER TRUE of this copy, and is left standing as the record of what the shared crate was for.
    //! Contract conformance for [`busbar_contract::records::RecordStore`] — the checks every backend must pass identically.
    //!
    //! These exist because an audit found the fleet disagreeing with itself: the same input produced a
    //! different outcome depending on which store an operator had deployed. `revoke_credential` on an
    //! unknown id errored on three backends and silently succeeded on two. `delete_key` on an unknown id
    //! split the other way. `append_audit` on a duplicate `seq` had three distinct behaviours across four
    //! backends. None of that was a defect in any one backend — the trait doc had not settled it, so each
    //! implementation settled it alone.
    //!
    //! The trait doc settles it now, and this module is how that ruling stays settled. A backend calls
    //! these from its own test module; a new ruling added here reaches every backend on its next
    //! dependency bump, instead of being hand-copied into each repo and drifting again.
    //!
    //! # Namespacing, and why every helper takes one
    //!
    //! Two of the backends (store-postgres, store-mysql) run their suites against a SHARED, live
    //! database that is not reset between tests, and their CI can run more than one test binary against
    //! it at once. A fixture on a fixed id would then make two concurrent runs each other's failure —
    //! store-postgres's own audit test already derives its `seq` from the process id for exactly this
    //! reason. So every helper takes an `ns` (or an explicit `seq`) and derives its fixtures from it.
    //!
    //! The caller owns cleanup: **reset [`key_ids`] and [`credential_ids`] for your `ns`, and delete
    //! your `seq`, before calling.** An in-memory backend gets this for free by opening a fresh store;
    //! a shared-database backend must issue the deletes itself, since this crate has no SQL of its own.
    //!
    //! Usage, from a store plugin's own tests:
    //! ```ignore
    //! use busbar_plugin_testkit::store_conformance as conf;
    //!
    //! #[test]
    //! fn put_key_does_not_resurrect_a_tombstone() {
    //!     let ns = format!("conf{}", std::process::id());
    //!     hard_reset(&store, &conf::key_ids(&ns));   // the backend's own cleanup
    //!     conf::assert_put_key_does_not_resurrect_a_tombstone(&open(), &ns);

    //
    // The opaque `body` is a serialized row exactly as core sends it (`serde_json`, the same the
    // backends decode with), and the `kind` strings match the reference `impl Store` verbatim. Read-back
    // is compared as the DECODED row, so a backend that stores typed columns and re-encodes conforms
    // without matching byte-for-byte on an incidental field order.
    //
    // This module is DELIBERATELY OPAQUE over the plane row types: it names none of the protocol row
    // structs (`TaskRow`/`TaskEventRow`/`McpCallRecord`/`McpDemotionRow`, relocated out of the shared api crate
    // into the plane crates). The `body` is just serialized JSON with the field NAMES a backend that
    // projects a kind into typed columns decodes by — so these throwaway stand-in structs carry exactly
    // those fields, and a backend that stores the body verbatim and one that decodes/re-encodes it both
    // conform.
    //
    // SKIP on a backend that provides no durable plane state (the defaulted keep-nothing — e.g. the RAM
    // default). Namespacing follows the module doc: derive fixtures from `ns` and reset the plane tables
    // for that `ns` before calling on a shared-database backend.
