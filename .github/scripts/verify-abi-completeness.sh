# ABI-COMPLETENESS GATE: refuse to build a plugin artifact whose source implements RecordStore
# methods that the PINNED busbar ABI cannot carry.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `.busbar-ref` pins the exact busbar commit a release builds and packs against.
# The plugin's `impl RecordStore for ...` is compiled against `busbar-contract` from that commit, and
# the wire is the same crate's `store_dispatch` (crates/busbar-contract/src/abi/sdk/mod.rs) — the
# match arm that turns a decoded store request into a call on the store.
# `busbar_contract::records::RecordStore` gives several methods a DEFAULT body, so a method the pinned
# dispatch never routes does not fail to compile: it compiles, ships, signs, attests, and then
# silently takes the default at runtime. busbar 74a1f9fa ("a task written through a plugin store is
# no longer discarded") is exactly that failure, already shipped once: a store that implemented
# `put_task` perfectly had every task DISCARDED at the ABI while `put_task` reported success.
#
# That class of defect is invisible to every other gate in this repo. The test suite exercises the
# in-process trait; fmt/clippy/build cannot see it; verify-assets only proves an asset exists. So this
# script checks the one thing nothing else does:
#
#   for every method this repo implements in `impl RecordStore for <T>`,
#   the pinned busbar's crates/busbar-contract/src/abi/sdk/mod.rs must actually call `store.<method>(`.
#
# A method implemented here but unrouted there is a SILENT DATA-LOSS PATH. It is a hard failure.
#
# This is deliberately generic — it is not a list of task methods. Any future RecordStore method
# added to a plugin ahead of the pinned engine trips it the same way, so the gate cannot go stale the
# way a hardcoded pin can.
